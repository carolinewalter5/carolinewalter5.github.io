## Projects 
### Undergraduate Thesis - [plinkQC](https://meyer-lab-cshl.github.io/plinkQC/)

Received Highest Honors Designation on Senior Honors Thesis for a major in Computational Biology, Department of Interdisciplinary Studies. 

Partnered with the Meyer Laboratory at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to build and enhance a CRAN-indexed R-package based on PLINK that performs a range of basic, large-scale statistical analyses, allows for robust, customizable quality control (QC) on genomic data for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and offers improved implementation for identifying diverse ancestries and their subsequent association studies, ensuring more inclusivity across GWAS.
